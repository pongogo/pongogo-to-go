# Pongogo Seeded Instructions Manifest
#
# This manifest tracks the version and contents of seeded instruction files.
# Pongogo uses this to check for updates and manage instruction file versions.
#
# Version Scheme:
#   - Bundle version: SemVer (major.minor.patch) for the entire instruction set
#   - File versions: Individual SemVer tracking per file
#
# Update Flow:
#   1. User runs `pongogo update --check` to see available updates
#   2. System compares local manifest.bundle_version with remote
#   3. If newer version available, shows diff of changed files
#   4. User approves update, system downloads and replaces files
