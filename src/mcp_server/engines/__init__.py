"""Routing Engine Package

This directory is reserved for the routing engine infrastructure.

Note: Frozen routing engine versions (durian_00.py, durian_05.py, etc.) are
internal-only and maintained in Super Pongogo for A/B testing and evaluation.
They are NOT synced to pongogo-to-go per the sync policy.

The active router is pongogo_router.py in the parent directory.

See: pongogo_to_go_sync.instructions.md for sync policy details.
